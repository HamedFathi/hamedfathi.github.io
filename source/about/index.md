title: About Me
---

Hello! I'm a seasoned software developer with over a decade of experience in programming. I've spent my career broadening my skills in software development, keeping pace with the ever-evolving tech industry.

My professional journey started in Iran, where I earned an Associate, Bachelor, and Master of Science in Computer Software Engineering. These formal educational endeavours shaped the foundation of my knowledge in the field, allowing me to cultivate my technical abilities and apply them in the real world.

I've served in various capacities throughout my career, each role adding a unique facet to my skillset. From my early days as a Software Developer at Behpardaz Jahan to my tenure as a Senior Software Developer at the Iranian National Tax Administration (INTA), I honed my proficiency in Microsoft's .NET ecosystem, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. While working at INTA, I was crucial in projects like the Management Information System (MIS) application, Integrated Tax System (ITS), and a system to detect money-laundering activities. Each endeavour allowed me to apply my technical prowess, leadership skills, and innovative thinking to solve complex problems and contribute to significant national projects.

My passion for ensuring the highest quality in software led me to a Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer role at Ringana GmbH in Austria. Here, I pioneered automated strategies to streamline testing processes, increase the precision and reliability of test results, and drive workflow efficiency. My technical expertise and my knack for problem-solving helped me create systems that reinforced the QA process.

I am an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engineer at Ringana GmbH. In this role, I implement AI-driven strategies to enhance the company's operational workflows, revolutionizing business processes using Azure Cognitive Services and Azure OpenAI Service.

Iâ€™m also proud to be a part of the open-source community, and my contributions are a testament to my ability to work as part of a team. I'm known for my creativity, technical acumen, determination, and unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of tech and helping my team reach our shared objectives.

My hobbies reflect my passion for continuous learning and my curiosity about the world. I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest technological advancements, actively contributing to open-source software projects, and writing technical articles to share my knowledge. Literature and entertainment form the lighter side of my interests, as I often find myself engrossed in renowned novels, the latest movies, TV series, and engaging computer games.

In a nutshell, I'm a .NET guru, problem resolver, passionate self-learner, and dedicated team player. My multifaceted career and lifelong pursuit of knowledge have helped me become a well-rounded software developer. I continuously strive to drive innovation and achieve excellence in all my endeavours. Whether I'm on the job or off, I always seek to learn, grow, and contribute to the world of tech.
